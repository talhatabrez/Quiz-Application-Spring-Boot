This is a simple quiz application. But the intent here is to get an idea 
about how the Spring Framework along with Spring Boot updates the files and does its magic in the backend.
This project does not have a UI, therefore we have to use PostMan to perform the CRUD operations, 
therefore it supposedly can be integrated with React UI to create a beautiful and dynamic interaction with the user.

Tech Stack Used: 
  Programming: Java, Spring Framework (Data JPA, Spring Boot.etc)
  DataBase: PostgreSQL used with pgAdmin4

The database for this project has been added in another readme file, please check that!
